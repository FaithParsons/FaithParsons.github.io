I wear many hats, and most of them have data tags.



### Data Manager

I'm a Data Manager at the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health [CBCH](http://www.columbiacardiology.org/research/center-behavioral-cardiovascular-health). I work closely with the rest of the Data Team in designing and building web-based data entry applications for many of our research studies, running data QA checks, creating key variables for analysis, running analysis and data visualization. Some of the studies I worked on include:

*   A clinical trial comparing depression treatments after heart attack [CODIACS](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01032018) 

*   A clinical trial assessing the quality of life of patients after heart attack [CODIACS QoL](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01993017)

*   Epidemiological studies on patients who go to the Emergency Room with symptoms of heart attack or stroke

*   An N-of-1 trial on the [Ecological Link of Psychosocial Stress to Exercise: Personalized Pathways](https://osf.io/kmszn/)

*   [Study of the effects of negative emotions on endothelial functions](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01909895)  

### Graduate student of Biostatistics

I'm also a part-time student in the MS Biostatistics (Theory and Methods track) program at the [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) and my adviser is [Prof. Christine Mauro](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/cmm2212). I'm very excited to be in my final semester, and look forward to finishing all my requirements in December.


### Statistical Consultant

I am a lifelong learner, and by being a statistical consultant, I get to work with and learn from a diverse clientele with diverse datasets.  I have been a **Top Rated Freelancer** on [Upwork.Com](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~011c2117ecbd36eeca/) and some of the projects I worked on include analysis of: 

*   Airline noise in select Los Angeles neighborhoods

*   Socio-demographic, behavioral and biological factors affecting the health of African American women

*   Low English proficiency (LEP) and dropout rates among Hispanic elementary, middle school and high school students

*   Effect of cultural and behavioral factors on cervical cancer screening among Arab and Hispanic women

*   Perceptions and experiences of intimate partner violence among hispanic college students 

*   Horse and jockey characteristics and race ranking

*   Physical, economic, and regulatory factors affecting real estate prices 

### Scientist's wife

My husband works on a lot of cool projects in Conservation Biology and Chemical Ecology. I enjoy assisting him in field data collection -- some were in the remote mining areas in the Australian outback. We also regularly talk about data and stats, and have published two peer-reviewed papers together: 

*   [The discovery of the 'transient' male Tibetan wild ass: Alternative 'sneaky' mating tactics in a wild equid?](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1568539x-00003407)

*   [The temporal multimodal influence of optical and auditory cues on the repellent behaviour of ring-billed gulls (Larus delewarensis)](http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1071/WR15001)
