### Data connoisseur & technology enthusiast

#### I love puzzles! Data and technology are but pieces of the big public health research puzzle. My goal is to make the most of my knowledge in statistics and technology, and maximize the skills and interests of my team, to improve the efficiency of research data collection and analysis, so we can solve public health problems faster.
